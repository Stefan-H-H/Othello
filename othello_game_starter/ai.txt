AI
------------------
1) The AI was built such that each time it was the AI's turn, it would 
   choose to perform a legal move that maximizes the number of opposing
   disks to be flipped. (AKA Greedy algorithm).
2) I was able to implement the Greedy algorithm. The AI could be smarter with a better
   algorithm.
3) The AI determined how to play the next disk by simply evaluting the most locally
   optimum decision of maximizing the number of of opposing disk to be flipped.
4) Through testing, the computer won approximately 20% of the time against other human
   opponents.
5) In the future, to futher improve the AI, I would seek to implement some sort of algorithm
   that prioritizes the corners and edges while simultaneously looking to minimize the total
   possible moves for the human opponent.
